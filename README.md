# Mission-to-Mars

HTML web scraping to create a Flask app on Mars data.

- Python 3.9.7
- VS Code 1.65.2
- Jupyter Notebook 6.4.8
- Mongo DB 5.0.6

## Overview

We helped Robin with a web app to scrape data. We used BeautifulSoup and Splinter to scrape Mars news, create a table on mars information, and hemisphere information in full resolution. We were tasked with setting up a button that can get the latest news and data on Mars was displayed on a webpage. Using Bootstrap's grid system to help manage and organize the data in a presentable way so anyone can click on and see updated information. The script used can be seen from mobile devices as well.
